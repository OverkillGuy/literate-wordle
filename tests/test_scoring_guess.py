"""Validates the Gherkin file features/scoring_guess.feature:

Feature: Scoring guesses
  As a Wordle game
  I need to tell the player how good their guess is
  In order to help them find the proper answer

Scenario: Perfect guess gives perfect score
  Given a wordle answer "crane"
  When scoring the guess "crane"
  Then score should be "ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©"

Scenario: No character in common
  Given a wordle answer "brave"
  When scoring the guess "skill"
  Then score should be "â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ"

Scenario: Character in wrong place
  Given a wordle answer "rebus"
  When scoring the guess "skull"
  Then score should be "ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ"

Scenario Outline: Scoring guesses
  Given a wordle <answer>
  When scoring <guess>
  Then score should be <score>

# Emoji (Unicode) character rendering is hard:
# Please forgive the table column alignment issues!
  Examples: A few guesses and their score
    | answer  | guess	| score		|
    | adage   | adobe	| ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©	|
    | serif   | quiet	| â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ	|
    | raise   | radix	| ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ	|
