"""Statistical approach to solving Wordle, via brute-force pre-computation.

Use our score_guess function to compute (offline) all possible scores of all valid
guesses against all possible answers.

Use SQLite as database for computed values.
To minimize storage requirements, words and scores are replaced by their indexes.

Statistical analysis will be done in later phase in SQL, exploiting the data this file
provides.
