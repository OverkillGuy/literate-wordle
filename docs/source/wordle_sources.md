# Source of Literate Wordle

Below is the raw org-mode file that was rendered to [Literate Programming
Wordle](wordle.md) in the previous documentation page.

This is intended for people curious about how the plain-text file behind the "novel" looks like. If you just wanted to read the novel comfortably, take a look at the previous page instead.

```{literalinclude} ../../wordle.org
