# Literate programming wordle

Including the entire `wordle.org` file raw, without any processing.

Unfortunately, the sphinx documentation generator doesn't understand org-mode
files, so I can't render this prettily yet.

```{eval-rst}
See also the `HTML version <_static/wordle.html>`_ now
```


```{literalinclude} ../../wordle.org
```
